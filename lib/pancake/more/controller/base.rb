  # TODOS:
  # * Sketch out how action dispatch will work
  # * What helpers do we need for dealing with different formats?
  # * What are the different errors that might arise in dispatch? 404 etc.
  # * Get before and after hooks working. These wrap around all action calls
  #   by default, so the hooks in extlib arenâ€™t useful. Additionally, the 
  #   the dispatch step gives us a point to hook in before and after the call.
