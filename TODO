TODO:

Middleware Stack:
  Add stack types, eg, development, production, staging, demo etc.  Allow multiple [:production, :demo]
  
Path Management:
  Allow named paths to be setup.  Paths should include a glob similar to merb push paths
  Many roots must be enabled for when using as a gem, and mounting in an app
  Paths should be inheritable across stacks, and should be tied to a specific stack
  Path management should be a mixin to allow any class to implement

Controller Publish Declaration:
  Allow requirements to be declared for multiple controllers at once
  Support syntax for coercing multiple values into a single param entry i.e. two date strings into a range
  Default values should be generated with a method rather than a static value alone
  The list of params should be able to be flagged as exclusive i.e. no additional parameters may be passed in
  Handle nested params
  Collect options suitable for a OPTIONS request from a client
  Mechanism to whitelist fields from a model
  
Renderable Mixin
  Design interface for adapters -- adapters allow support for different template libs
  Compiled templates need to be cached
  Options used by the mixin need to be configurable
  Templates should be inheritable
  The target class should be able to inject arbitrary helpers into the template context
  Layouts, views and partials should be supported
