TODO:

Middleware Stack:
  Add stack types, eg, development, production, staging, demo etc.  Allow multiple [:production, :demo]
  
Path Management:
  Allow named paths to be setup.  Paths should include a glob similar to merb push paths
  Many roots must be enabled for when using as a gem, and mounting in an app
  Paths should be inheritable across stacks, and should be tied to a specific stack
  Path management should be a mixin to allow any class to implement
